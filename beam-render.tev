# say texmap1 is a texture containing separate channels of accumulated "beam"
# brightness: we want the sum of the R, G & B channels. Texcoord1 just maps
# screen coordinates directly to texcoords.

stage 0:
  tev.rgb = clamp (texmap1[texcoord1].rrr + texmap1[texcoord1].ggg);

stage 1:
  tev.rgb = clamp (tev.rgb + texmap1[texcoord1].bbb);
