# Annoyingly, indirect textures use channels A,B,G to map to the S,T,U texture
# coordinates, and we have an RGB image. Switch the colour around.
# We lose two bits of precision doing this (changing from RGB8 to RGBA6), but
# we're only interested in the bottom end of the scale, so that's not important.
# Multiply values by 4, with clamping.
