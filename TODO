TODO list/running order
=======================

Musix
-----

Play streaming raw PCM/ADPCM from ARAM. FFMPEG has an ADX encoder; use that? [DONE]

Static/text only/loading part
-----------------------------

* Add something at the start.

CRTC logo (soft_crtc)
---------------------

* Start with CRTC logo (dropping in like tetris blocks?). Maybe life-effect it away, but quickly. [DONE]

* Add camera path. [DONE]

Tentacle (in box, colour-channel split)
---------------------------------------

* Fade in from black [DONE]

* Time to music (several parameters...). Don't start with colour split, make that happen later.

Pumpkins
--------

* Drop pile of solid pumpkins, three on top of each other. [DONE]

* Middle one spins round, and has a terrible face! Lights up. Try to restrict to good angles... [DONE]

* Camera path, slow moving. [DONE]

Snake
-----

* Add fog texture!

Reflecting skull
----------------

* Fix horrible crash! [DONE]

* Add camera path [DONE]

* Sky pulsing red to music! [DONE, sorta]

* Check: is normal perturbation still correct? [PROBABLY]

Glass
-----

* Add old-film fade to edge effect.

* Different object? Tentacles or blobs! [DONE, just another demo-like static object...]

Bloom
-----

* Use mipmap levels/hardware box filter to get rid of jaggies. [doesn't work quite like I thought; still, using hardware box filter will probably speed up the bloom effect a little.]

* Dunno, add background? Inside of pumpkin?

Tubes
-----

* More exciting movement? Dunno.

Spooky ghost tunnel
-------------------

* Fix jitter on spooky ghost in tunnel

* Red & blue & yellow colours for spooky ghost in tunnel, make a fun left/right pattern. Or straight towards viewer sometimes.

* End credits using bitmap font.
